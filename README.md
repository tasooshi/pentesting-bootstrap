![Screenshot](img/screenshot.jpg)

## Requirements

* Latest Kali Linux for x86_64
* 40GB of free disk space

## Installation

1. Create a fresh image based on latest Kali Linux (assumes accepting default meta-packages: top10 and default).
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/tasooshi/pentesting-bootstrap.git`
3. `$ sudo pentesting-bootstrap/bootstrap.sh` (`-q` to silence output)
4. Answer a few questions (or skip them with `-y`).

(Optional)

5. In case you need support for wireless adapter: `bootstrap.rtl88*.sh`

## Packages

### Base

#### `kali.base.sh`

Consists of packages not installed by default in Kali Linux and the ones that I had found useful over the years: extra compilers, utilities for data extraction, less common file systems or protocols etc.

### Extra

#### `kali.extra.source-packages.sh`

Downloads non-packaged binaries and source code in case you end up without Internet access (mostly from Github).

#### `kali.extra.socat-openssl-v23.sh`

Really handy when dealing with legacy systems not supporting modern TLS.

#### `kali.extra.sublime-text.sh`

Personal choice of mine, highly recommended for improving productivity. Great both for programming and note taking.

#### `kali.extra.kalitorify.sh`

There are some good uses, too. Not enabled by default.

## Usage

```
usage: bootstrap.sh [-h] [-q] [-y]
