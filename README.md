# pentesting-bootstrap

> Fast and easy way of setting up a self-contained and hardened pentesting environment with Kali Linux

* Platform: x86_64

## Installation

1. Create a fresh image based on latest Kali Linux (assumes accepting default meta-packages: top10 and default).
2. Execute `bootstrap.sh` script and answer a few questions.

(Optional)

3. In case you need support for Alfa AWUS1900 wireless adapter: `bootstrap.alfa.awus1900.sh`

## Suggestions

- Disable IPv6 unless you have a very good reason not to.
- Enable host name changing, some people prefer security model based on knowing who the adversary is.

## Base packages

### `kali.base.sh`

Consists of packages not installed by default in Kali Linux and the ones that I had found useful over the years: extra compilers, utilities for data extraction, less common file systems or protocols etc.

## Extra packages

### `kali.extra.source-packages.sh`

Downloads non-packaged binaries and source code in case you end up without Internet access (mostly from Github).

### `kali.extra.socat-openssl-v23.sh`

Really handy when dealing with legacy systems not supporting modern TLS.

### `kali.extra.sublime-text.sh`

Personal choice of mine, highly recommended for improving productivity. Great both for programming and note taking.

### `kali.extra.kalitorify.sh`

There are some good uses, too.
