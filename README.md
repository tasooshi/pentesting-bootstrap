> Fast and easy way of setting up a self-contained and hardened pentesting environment with Kali Linux

![Screenshot](img/screenshot.jpg)

## Requirements

* Latest Kali Linux for x86_64
* 40GB of free disk space

## Installation

1. Create a fresh image based on latest Kali Linux (assumes accepting default meta-packages: top10 and default).
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/tasooshi/pentesting-bootstrap.git`
3. `$ sudo pentesting-bootstrap/bootstrap.sh` (`-q` to silence output)
4. Answer a few questions (or skip them with `-y`).

(Optional)

5. In case you need support for wireless adapter: `bootstrap.rtl88*.sh`

## Packages

These are the optional "packages":

### `kali.extra.disable.ipv6.sh`

Disabling IPv6 system-wide.

### `kali.extra.hardening.sh`

Restricting SSH, IPv4, default file permissions etc.

### `kali.extra.kalitorify.sh`

There are some good uses, too.

### `kali.extra.namechange.sh`

Changes host name to a random string that makes sense, after each reboot.

### `kali.extra.packages.sh`

Consists of packages not installed by default in Kali Linux and the ones that I had found useful over the years: extra compilers, utilities for data extraction, less common file systems or protocols etc.

### `kali.extra.socat-openssl-v23.sh`

Really handy when dealing with legacy systems not supporting modern TLS.

### `kali.extra.source-packages.sh`

Downloads non-packaged binaries and source code in case you end up without Internet access (mostly from Github).

### `kali.extra.sublime-text.sh`

Personal choice of mine, highly recommended for improving productivity. Great both for programming and note taking.

### `kali.extra.wide-compatibility.sh`

Enables SSH client to talk to legacy systems.
